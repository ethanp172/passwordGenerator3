# Password Generator V3
A simple password generator written in Python, using [Custom Tkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). Every new language I learn, my first small project is a password generator.

You can edit a few settings, and then click `generate`. Then you have a securly generated password, that you can directly copy to your clipboard.
